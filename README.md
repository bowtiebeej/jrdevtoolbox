# The Junior Developer Toolbox
Currently located at http://juniordevtoolbox.azurewebsites.net.  

### The purpose of this site is to help provide tools for other junior developers and those learning to code. 

Right now we're just getting this up and running but it will eventually be a blog for junior and senior developers to post tricks and tools.
